Theano-Tutorials
================

Bare bones introduction to machine learning from linear regression to convolutional neural networks using Theano.

###Exploring Neural Nets with Single Dimensional Functions
One can explore how different hyper-parameters, like learning rate, weight initialization, and number of epochs changes the learning process of mathematical functions like $x^2$, $\abs(x)$, and $\sin(x)$. 

Please experiment with a simple neural network in `/net.py`. You must have `Theano` installed (duh - Theano-Tutorials!). You can run the program by typing in your console `python net.py`.

Here's an example of a neural network, with a hidden layer with 4 nodes, learning on $\sin(x)$ from $[-5, 5]$.
